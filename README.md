# Building a JavaScript Development Environment
This is a repo for containing my notes, example code, etc. from the Building a JavaScript Development Environment course by Cory House on PluralSight

## Module #1:  Introduction

General idea is that in order to avoid missing steps, avoid re-creating things each and every time you need to do JavaScript development, you should instead build a "starter kit" that you can use over and over.

The author said he was inspired by the book The Checklist Manifesto; by the idea of professionals in many fields using checklists.  The general idea is that "...we think we can remember all the steps..." but in reality we can't or don't.  Example:  Doctors use checklists for starting a line on a patient.
